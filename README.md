## ðŸ©º Overview
Skin diseases affect millions globally, and early detection plays a crucial role in preventing severe complications.  
This project introduces a **deep learning-based diagnostic system** using **Vision Transformers (ViT)** â€” a state-of-the-art model architecture renowned for its ability to understand global image dependencies better than traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Through extensive experimentation, we developed, trained, and deployed a Vision Transformer model capable of classifying **four major skin conditions** with **91.19% test accuracy**.
